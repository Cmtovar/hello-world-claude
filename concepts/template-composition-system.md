# Template Composition System - Primary Source

I forgot to mention that, but yes, composition will be critical. I kind of said it at the surface level, but you went a level deeper and captured the heart of it. When I said control complexity, it was in reference to if conditions, control flow, where a function has integrative actions unique to it, yet it is composed of sometime optional other functions which have their own definitions. I conveyed the surface of conditional selection among composed snippets, but you got the complete picture that yes, architecturally, there would be composition, where can pull the whole template into the frame of another template, or if it's idempotent pull a template from within another template into the frame of this template. Mix and choosing.

Of course, template design would be information accessible to the player somehow, as well as an out of level location the player can see templates on a more detailed scale to prepare for battles that is a distinct UI compared to the immediate use UI the player has available in the battle. These could be two buildings in the player village or the player resting area between battles whatever it may be where the player can intentionally decompose and arrange templates in detail, without worrying about the heat of battle and read in-game information from books, NPCs, or other guides that help the user format templates as composable design patterns, both prescriptively with prebuilt patterns as well as conceptual information that supports users custom built templates.
