Exactly, like if you have a technique that moves a teammate, you can fill the vulnerability time with movement to protect megumin. And yes, being able to include and practice play around hazards. Basically, template composition lets you frame a local approach within a given context that you can mount into your current situation through the blueprint system.

There would need to be another building that grants access to an almanac / piklopedia place where a player can investigate what it does. Then they can compose a template using the environmental asset as an ally, or as an enemy. The template IDE creator would need to have a playback feature that lets the user step through the template temporally, and it exhibits behavior, therefore a player touching on sensitive environmental materials like this can explore the behavior of this new asset, and compose a handler input/output template that gets composed within the context of a template that involves using these environmental assets in context.

So, the user might need to read a book to devise a strategy design pattern to handle the plant, then that pattern is now a composable unit to other templates. Something like that where they can get the behavior they need.

I think this starts opening a question of unit balancing. Because say you have templates for generic knights but then you have a child that can't do all the same things. Well, that's a simple matter. Even if you have an abundance of templates, acquiring an underpowered unit would still limit you to the capabilities that unit has. It's why I've built such a focus on dependencies since a child might be able to do most of the same things a knight could do, but they lack the skill to wield a sword as effectively, therefore some templates are inaccessible.
