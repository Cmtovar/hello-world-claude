I think it would make sense to swap equipment mid-battle. Fire emblem lets you carry some items in your inventory, locked to maybe 5 slots or so, and then units can trade equipment amongst themselves during the battle or maybe go to a place on the map to restock a different item. This kind of brings up the topic of weapon durability. I personally played fates conquest lunatic as my introduction to fire emblem (well, not lunatic, I started with hard) and so I think weapons that don't break can still be here.

I feel like I'd want more emphasis on techniques and their correspondence to AP consumption. I guess to pull more inspiration from splatoon's white ink frames which is a hard, unavoidable offset to the refilling of ink after a heavy action, this is our cooldown mechanic sort of, where suppose a witch does a huge explosion spell (like megumin from konosuba), she can do the attack sure, even multiple times, but her AP completely expires and she has a long time of pure offset for her to even move again, not even questioning another explosion spell.

Different techniques are where more of my interest is, so we could even limit items to as little as 2 inventory slots. Like a primary and auxiliary. Then attach items on the battlefield or within spells that temporarily augment the weapon, or a technique that strikes a foe in a unique way, mostly independent of the weapon. If someone equips a weapon with an innate attribute to it that might otherwise only be found in a special technique, then that weapon would be balanced against other weapons, pre-consideration of the skills first, and then perhaps on the skill availability due to this weapon's intrinsic lean towards a particular function. (This is my dragon slayer because instead of needing to consume extra AP to use a dragon taming technique, they equipped a weapon before entering the level that intrinsically applies that skill to every basic attack, without consuming extra AP).

I think the most important thing is using your environment to find weapons or utilize the environment as a weapon like say there's large carnivorous plants, knock enemies into it, or agitate the plant so it lunges, etc.
