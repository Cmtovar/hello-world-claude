# Progression Through Units, Not Tools - Primary Source

Yes! Enemies and allies teach you! Eventually you'll be able to do it, even if they've literally advanced from the fundamentals, you have the fundamentals. An arc is a bunch of movement displacements strung along. And the attack along that arc consumes AP. You might recap AP at the tail end of the arc, so you can finish with another attack at the new position. All of this you can be inspired from (perhaps literally studying action history during or after a battle to decompose what you can do after having now witnessed it) and since the game is designed these declarative constraint systems and composable idempotent micro pieces, the player has room to, in I guess an open source style, learn systems thinking through immersion.

The conceptual lessons for the user to create their own templates would help explain the meta layer of design, and the game has the layers built in to support the player at that high level of design (because it's computerized you can runtime templates from the outside and see what happens instead of being stuck in the loop. Yes a demonstration of what is possible at your current skill ceiling.

I think I prefer how to use tools you already have. Because it really shouldn't be the player that feels limited for template design. We only limit the size and number of nested compositions for the sake of game balance, but ideally every option should be on the table (because a player can think about anything), but then make the progression more closely tied to the units the player is using. A random knight couldn't make sky rainbows, but they can hold up their shield. Stuff like that. The player isn't limited, but their units, the tools they have to express their knowledge is limited. More powerful level presence is what is gatekept, but the ability to format your templates should be completely open and mostly unchanging.

Informative books etc would either familiarize the player with the tools they already have available or items of that sort would moreso be progression items tied to the individual character. These need not always be key items. Even giving someone a shield versus a sword would make a tactical difference. A unit that refills AP is distinct from one that is more slothful, or doesn't recharge as fast. A debuff of weakening might target a units AP regen, making templates inaccessible but the player can still create that template and have it accessible for moments when the debuff isn't access. This is how I think the game would be balanced. A player that has the most intricate ideas shouldn't be punished with inaccessess, yet if the units they're using can't do those intricate behaviors, then that's when the player needs to think in the long term about how they can do such things, or keep it on the backburner and think of a new template.
