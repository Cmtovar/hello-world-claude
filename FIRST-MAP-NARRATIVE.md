# First Map: The Bridge at Old Fort Crossing - Complete Narrative Design

**Date:** 2026-01-29
**Status:** Complete concept, ready for implementation
**Type:** Tutorial/Story introduction map

---

## Map Overview

**Name:** The Bridge at Old Fort Crossing
**Size:** 20x20 tiles
**Height Range:** 2-3 levels (river low, ground level, bridge/ruins)
**Theme:** Abandoned military battlement with rope bridge over creek
**Difficulty:** Tutorial/Easy
**Estimated Duration:** 15-20 minutes first playthrough

---

## Physical Geography

### The Bridge (Primary Structure)
- Rope bridge spanning small creek/river
- Majority of map real estate
- Cobblestone support pillars on either bank
- Wooden plank surface with visible dip in middle
- Rope railings along sides
- Torches along bridge length

### The River/Creek
- Low ground beneath bridge
- Sandy banks
- Cattail-like foliage growing from marshy wet soil
- Normally shallow (dried creek bed areas)
- **Dynamic:** Water level rises during rain event

### The Ruins (Far Side)
- Old military battlement
- Primarily cobblestone and wood construction
- Collapsed towers (structural remains)
- Minimal ceilings/upper floors
- Some platforms to stand on
- Cool, damp, dark spaces inside (anomaly preference)
- Torches at entrance/key locations
- Signs of age: crumbling walls, overgrown vegetation

### Approach Path (Near Side)
- Clear ground leading to bridge
- Some natural cover (bushes, rocks)
- Safe staging area

---

## Environmental Hazards

### Rain Event (Triggered)
**Trigger:** Baby anomaly gets startled

**Effects:**
- Lighting changes (darker, atmospheric)
- Water level rises in river
- Wind blows torch flames
- Visibility reduction
- Creates atmospheric tension

**Does NOT damage players** (this is important - special life-giving rain)

### Rising Water
- Floods low ground areas
- Forces players to higher elevation
- Blocks retreat through creek bed
- Creates urgency to reach bridge

### Zombies (Revealed by Rising Water)
- Submerged casualties beneath river
- Rise from water when level increases
- Horde toward group
- **Environmental enemies, not primary threat**

---

## Story Context

### Who You Are
**Player Group:** Humble beginnings mercenary squad
- **Background:** Handle tasks for townsfolk
- **Specialty:** Retrieving items from dangerous locations civilians can't reach
- **Experience Level:** Not their first mission, but still learning
- **Team Dynamic:** Playful, casual, capable under pressure

### Why You're Here
**Mission:** Retrieve specific item from old ruins
- **Expectation:** Routine salvage mission
- **Reality:** Unexpected encounter with anomalous creatures

**The Item:** [To be defined - something townsperson requested]
- Located in the ruins
- Covered in purple viscous residue when found

### What This Place Was
**Historical Context:** Old military battlement
- **Original Purpose:** Defend country at edge of town
- **Former Users:** Military garrison
- **Current State:** Long abandoned, taken over by nature and anomalies
- **Significance:** Well-built bridge suggests importance
- **Mystery:** Why did soldiers fall here? What made this place special?

**Distance from Town:** Far enough that zombies aren't immediate civilian threat

## World Questions Raised

### About the Anomaly
1. What was that creature?
2. Why did it stoke rain when startled?
3. Is this a baby? What will it be like when older?
4. Where did it come from?
5. Are there more? Family groups?

### About the Rain
1. Was this special rain? (Life-giving properties?)
2. Why didn't it hurt the group?
3. Did the rain raise the zombies, or just reveal them?
4. How far did the rain extend?
5. What did it look like from alchemist's perspective?

### About the Zombies

4. Can I learn magic?

---

## Magic System Introduction

### Alchemist's Role (Distinct)
**Archetype:** Engineer/Artificer
- Imbues artifacts with magic
- Creates magical items
- Not direct spell-casting
- Methodical, studied approach

**Example Creations:**
- **Warmth Stone:** Heated artifact, protects from frostbite
- **Flying Book:** Familiar-like companion that hovers
- **Flame Orb:** Breaks rain, burns undead, contains holy water

### General Magic Users
- Use magic more liberally
- Direct casting
- Different from alchemist's approach
- Suggests magic is relatively common

### Implication
- Multiple approaches to magic exist
- Alchemy is specialized, technical
- Direct magic is more widespread
- Both are valid paths

---

## Character Development Moments

### Group Dynamics Shown
**Before Encounter:**
- Playful with each other
- Casual exploration
- Comfortable teamwork

**During Crisis:**
- Gather bearings quickly
- Coordinate using blueprint mode
- Stay calm under pressure
- Support each other

**After Escape:**
- Different coping mechanisms (art, stories, research, play)
- Process trauma differently
- Maintain group cohesion

### Individual Characterization
**Based on Creek vs Bridge Choice:**
- Risk-takers went to creek bed (almost caught in flood)
- Cautious ones took bridge (safer, but further from loot)
- Shows personality through player decisions

**Based on Post-Battle Activities:**
- Artists process visually
- Scholars process intellectually
- Social characters process through storytelling
- Playful characters seek normalcy
- Curious characters seek answers

### Collective Competence
**Demonstrated:**
- This isn't their first mission
- They can handle blueprint mode
- They escape tactfully
- They're not weak, just startled
- Experience shows under pressure

---

## Gameplay Loop Introduction

### Combat Tutorial (Subtle)
**Through Crisis, Not Instructions:**
- Rain event forces blueprint mode use
- Zombie threat creates urgency
- Bridge creates chokepoint
- Natural teaching through necessity

**Skills Taught:**
- Unit selection
- Movement coordination
- Line of sight breaking
- Threat prioritization
- Safe positioning
- Tactical retreat

### Town Exploration (Downtime)
**Purpose:**
- Breather after tension
- World-building
- Character development
- Introduce town locations

**Locations Introduced:**
- Bar/Tavern (social hub)
- Library (research/lore)
- Alchemist's Workshop (crafting/magic)
- Town Square/Fountain (play/normalcy)

### IDE/Blueprint Introduction
**Timing:** After return to town
**Format:** Introductory, not overwhelming

**Access Granted:**
- Basic template creation
- Review of battle that just happened
- Study past missions (memories)
- Decompose what happened

**Diegetic Framing:**
- "Let's review what happened"
- "We should prepare better next time"
- Characters suggest studying together
- Natural reason to engage with IDE

### Previous Mission Memories
**Concept:** Player can view battles before game started
**Constraints:** No decision-making access (playback only)
**Purpose:**
- Show group has history
- Provide sample battles to study
- Demonstrate mechanics in different contexts
- Establish that progression ≠ player joining

**Implication:**
- Group was capable before player arrived
- Player is learning to coordinate them, not making them capable
- Progression = better coordination, more units, better tools

---

## Progression Philosophy (Introduced)

### Player vs Character Capability
**Decoupled:**
- Characters are already capable
- Player learns to coordinate them
- Progression scales off units you have
- Player capability grows separately from character capability

**Lesson:**
- You're not "leveling up" the characters
- You're learning to use them better
- New units expand possibilities
- Templates capture learned strategies

### Significant Lessons Available
**For Players Who Want to Dive Deep:**
- Review battle in detail
- Study character capabilities
- Understand why escape worked
- Identify what could improve

**For Players Who Want Story:**
- Continue with narrative
- Engage with town
- Talk to characters
- Progress naturally

**Both Valid:**
- Game doesn't force IDE immediately
- But rewards those who engage
- Diegetic requirements re-engage story
- Balance between depth and accessibility

---

## Diegetic Story Engagement

### Problem to Solve
**Risk:** Player gets too deep in IDE, ignores story

### Solution: Natural Story Hooks
**Outside-of-Battle Moments That Teach:**

**Example 1: Alchemist Analysis**
- "Come back tomorrow, I'll have results on substance"
- Forces time passage
- Player does other activities
- When they return, learn about substance
- Natural progression gate

**Example 2: Library Research**
- Scholar character finds interesting book
- "You should read this"
- Teaches lore while teaching mechanics
- Book might describe battle techniques
- Dual-purpose learning

**Example 3: Bar Stories**
- Storyteller exaggerates encounter
- Local asks questions
- Player re-examines what actually happened
- Compare story to reality
- Teaches observation

**Example 4: Training with Alchemist**
- "Let me show you how I plan my artifact designs"
- Introduction to template IDE
- Alchemist as teacher NPC
- Makes IDE learning diegetic

## Map Design Specifics

### Voxel Types Needed
1. **Cobblestone** (gray) - Support structures, ruins
2. **Wooden Planks** (brown) - Bridge surface, some ruins
3. **Rope Constraints** (thin/invisible) - Bridge railings
4. **Sand** (tan) - River banks
5. **Cattails** (green) - Marsh vegetation
6. **Water** (blue, rising dynamically) - River
7. **Torch** (light source object)
8. **Rubble** (collapsed sections)

### Lighting
**Normal State:**
- Sunny/clear
- Torches provide accent lighting
- Good visibility

**Rain State:**
- Darker, atmospheric
- Torches flicker in wind
- Reduced visibility
- Dramatic shadows

### Enemy Placement

**Baby Anomaly:**
- Starts in dark ruin interior
- Triggered by player proximity
- Runs away (not hostile)
- Pathfinding toward far edge of map

**Zombies:**
- Submerged in river (invisible until rain)
- Rise when water level increases
- 5-8 zombies total
- Slow movement
- Horde behavior (group toward players)
- Not particularly strong (tutorial enemies)

### Player Start Position
**Near side of bridge, approaching**

### Victory Conditions
**Primary:** Escape across bridge to near side
**Secondary (Automatic):** Alchemist arrives, uses flame orb

**No Failure State:**
- Designed to be winnable
- Tutorial battle
- Alchemist saves if things go badly

---

## Implementation Notes

### Dynamic Weather System
**Required:**
- Toggle lighting (normal → rain)
- Water level animation (rising)
- Wind effect on torches
- Rain particle effects (visual)

### Zombie Reveal Mechanic
**Required:**
- Zombies start hidden/inactive
- Water level triggers activation
- Rise animation from submerged state
- Switch to active AI

### Alchemist Flame Orb
**Required:**
- Projectile physics (toss → impact)
- Shatter animation
- Area effect (burn zombies in radius)
- Weather clear effect
- Cutscene or scripted sequence

### Character Activities System
**Required:**
- Town location markers
- Character positioning after battle
- Dialogue triggers
- Activity animations (reading, drawing, playing)

---

## Testing Priorities

### Mechanical Testing
1. Bridge traversal (constraints work?)
2. Rain trigger (timing, effects)
3. Water level rise (pathfinding updates?)
4. Zombie spawn (positions, AI activation)
5. Escape coordination (blueprint mode under pressure)

### Narrative Testing
1. Pacing (exploration → startle → escape → rescue)
2. Tension curve (peaceful → urgent → relief)
3. Character moments (do they land?)
4. Question seeding (are players curious?)

### Tutorial Testing
1. Does player understand blueprint mode?
2. Is difficulty appropriate (scary but winnable)?
3. Do players engage with town afterward?
4. Do they want to explore IDE?
